Static blog generator written in bash. Static site generation because:
- Security
- Version controllable text
- Speed
- Use vi:)


Setup:
------
1. Clone repo to home dir, change if want somewhere else:
     $ git clone git@github.com:oliverfields/shblog.git ~/shblog

2. Create config file:
     $ cp ~/shblog/shblog.conf ~/.config/shblog.conf


Getting started:
----------------
1. Change to home directory (cd ~)

2. Initiate new blog, will create new directroy and populate it with required 
   files (from '~/shblog/blog_skel'):
     $ ~/shblog/shblog init myblog

3. Style blog by editing any file in 'myblog/html_parts' ('post_social.html'
   is appended after blog content on actual blog post page, useful for adding
   various social stuff, e.g. Facebook like button and/or Disqus comments).
   Create CSS files in '~/myblog/includes/css', on build they will be copied
   to '~/myblog/site/css'. CSS files are not automatically added to HTML, so
   must add regular HTML markup appropriate html part file, e.g.
   'html_parts/header.html'. The 'includes/javascript' and 'includes/images'
   are treated same way as CSS.

4. New posts are created in '~/myblog/post_source'. The files must be prefixed
   'YYYYMMDD_' and contain only lowercase letters, numbers or hyphens ('-').
   Post files start with headers (key value pairs), followed by a empty line
   and then content. Content is written in Pextile
   (http://pagegen.phnd.net/user-manual/pextile-markup-reference).

5. Build blog, 'update' will rebuild only pages that have
   changes. Use 'rebuild' to force rebuild of everything.
     $ ~/shblog/shblog update myblog

6. Copy directory '~/myblog/site' to web server.
